# Group Retrospective
Please provide responses for the following items. In all cases, you should be polite and professional. This is a public document which should appear in your GitHub Repository.

* What went well in the group...
  - Josiah Yount: I think that team coordination was pretty strong in our group. Once we got our vision down, it was mostly smooth sailing from there.
  - Robert: Despite working in a tech stack that none of us were familiar with, I think we ended up making a pretty decent game.
  - Cara: We figured out later on what each of us could do to contribute in a better way, and from there things went quite smoothly
  - Virginia: Because we chose to make a game, a lot of us were enthusiastic to learn about it and tried our hardest to make something very cool that we could be proud of. 
* What could have been better in the group...
  - Josiah Yount: Tasks could have been distributed a little better, I felt the workload was a little heavy on certain team members.
  - Robert: We started with a very large scope for the project. It took a while to pair it down into an achievable minimum viable specification. From the first day the team decided we were going to make a game, but we chose a technology stack none of us were familiar with. This led to a large learning curve getting up to speed with Godot before progress was able to be made. If i had to say one thing that could have been better, it would be choosing a project with a smaller scope from the beggining and one with which the team had at least some experience with. Despite that I am proud of what we were able to achieve over the semester.
  - Cara: We all used a software that none of us have used before which frustrated me a lot throughout the first half of the semester. I later found out I could use a software that I had experience with to create a map for the game. It wasn't hard to use the two together so it ended up being okay I guess.
  - Virginia: There were times where there was not much communication. Maybe because we didnt understand requirements well, but we didnt know how to organize our time and thoughts until the deadline arrived. We definitley had that problem for the deliverables, but we didnt have that problem when developing the game itself. But our Gantt chart was broken from week two.
* What went well in the class...
  - Josiah Yount: The class went well in general, I can't really pick out anything specific. I liked the guest lectures quite a bit.
  - Robert: The guest speakers were very interesting. I enjoyed hearing how different teams operate.
  - Cara: I liked that on lecture days there was still time left to work with the group. We got to take what we just learned and applied to our project in particular.
  - Virginia: I liked that we had a lot of freedom in choosing what to do and how to do it. 
* What could have been better in the class...
  - Josiah Yount: Perhaps the timing of in-class meetings. I can't really think of anything else.
  - Robert: The group formation process could be made more efficient. It was a bit chaotic and our group ended up without a grad student despite there being enough for every group. One other issue was all groups were instructed to utilize agile development, but were given no clear instruction on what that looks like at the start. It was fleshed out a bit with guest speakers but, having never done agile development before, a concrete example the workflow would have beeen helpful early on. For example, a run through of what a proper "standup" / agile meeting looks like or an example of a Kanban board used for a software development project.
  - Cara: I enjoyed the guest lectures, however I feel they weren't expecting their presentations to take so long. I feel class time ended with them still having more to share, which could've been important things to learn. It would've been nice to have a more interactive class as well, but that is not a problem with the class, more the students.
  - Virginia: In the beginning, I remember you saying something about how groups would have meetings where the instructor could assess if they were on track for a grade (maybe I'm wrong), but that didnt happen. I was confused because that's how projects for me have been in the past. Because of that, it seemed more unstructured and made me nervous. That could also be because there were many cancelled class days and also some where no one was required to show. I would have liked more structure, but maybe the structure was there, it was just wrong because our gantt chart was so screwed up so we never looked at it.
