# Group Retrospective
Please provide responses for the following items. In all cases, you should be polite and professional. This is a public document which should appear in your GitHub Repository.

* What went well in the group...
  - Josiah Yount: I think that team coordination was pretty strong in our group. Once we got our vision down, it was mostly smooth sailing from there.
  - Robert: Despite working in a tech stack that none of us were familiar with, I think we ended up making a pretty decent game. 
* What could have been better in the group...
  - Josiah Yount: Tasks could have been distributed a little better, I felt the workload was a little heavy on certain team members.
  - Robert: We started with a very large scope for the project. It took a while to pair it down into an achievable minimum viable specification. From the first day the team decided we were going to make a game, but we chose a technology stack none of us were familiar with. This led to a large learning curve getting up to speed with Godot before progress was able to be made. If i had to say one thing that could have been better, it would be choosing a project with a smaller scope from the beggining and one with which the team had at least some experience with. Despite that I am proud of what we were able to achieve over the semester. 
* What went well in the class...
  - Josiah Yount: The class went well in general, I can't really pick out anything specific. I liked the guest lectures quite a bit.
  - Robert: The guest speakers were very interesting. I enjoyed hearing how different teams operate. 
* What could have been better in the class...
  - Josiah Yount: Perhaps the timing of in-class meetings. I can't really think of anything else.
  - Robert: The group formation process could be made more efficient. It was a bit chaotic and our group ended up without a grad student despite there being enough for every group. One other issue was all groups were instructed to utilize agile development, but were given no clear instruction on what that looks like at the start. It was fleshed out a bit with guest speakers but, having never done agile development before, a concrete example the workflow would have beeen helpful early on. For example, a run through of what a proper "standup" / agile meeting looks like or an example of a Kanban board used for a software development project.
